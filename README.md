# CSE 141L (refocused)

Welcome to CSE 141L Introduction to Computer Architecture Lab.

This repo serves an the homepage for the course labs.  It contains all
the lab write ups and several resources you will use throughout the
course.

* `labs` has all the labs.  The write ups reference the starter repos they use.
* `slides` has the slides.

## Overview

We are going to optimize code to take advantage of architectural features of modern microprocessors. Along the way we will learn how to use several tools that will help.

The goals for the course are for you to learn how to test, profile, and optimize functions in C code, with a mind towards the pipeline and cache.  

## Labs 

There are 10 labs.  Deadlines are on the course homepage.

The slides for each lab are in the directory with the lab description.
