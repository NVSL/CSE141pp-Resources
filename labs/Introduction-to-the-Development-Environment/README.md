## Tasks to Perform

### Fill Out The Self Evaluation

Login to your __@ucsd.edu__ gmail account and fill out [this survey]().  You will receive
a copy of your responses via email.  Print it to a pdf and include it in your repo as `survey.pdf`.

### Get set up Github

We are going to use Github classroom for this course. You'll need to [create a Github account](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one. 
For each part of the project, there will be an assignment setup on Github. 
You and your teammates will commit your work to the repo in order to turn it in.

First, you'll need to authorize github classroom to access your github account. 
To do that, visit https://classroom.github.com and sign in with your github account.

Then click on the link for the starter repo listed in the "Software You Will Need" section above. (Not able to verify this!)

We will be using Github a lot in class. 
If you aren't familiar with it, there are a bunch of good introductory tutorials. 
For example, [this one](http://try.github.io/).
