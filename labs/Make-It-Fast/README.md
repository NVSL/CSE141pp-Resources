# Make It Fast

In this lab, you will make `sqmm()` as fast as you can.

This lab will be done in pairs.

This lab is due the day after the final.

Skills to Learn

1. Combine the optimizations you learned in the class.


## Software You Will Need

1. A computer with Docker installed (either the basement CSE labs or your own laptop).
2. The [starter repo](https://classroom.github.com/g/SIpfNUrS) for this lab. (Don't clone it until the start of class, last-minute changes are likely.)
3. The contents of the class materials Github repo: https://github.com/NVSL/CSE141pp_Resources

## Tasks to Perform

### Make it Fast

You should try to make `sqmm()` as fast as possible using parallelization and other techniques. You may use parallelization, blocking and manual loop unrolling.

You must beat Devon and Justin's submissions on the Gradescope leader board in __WallTime__ for full credit. Your final submission to Gradescope should be your code that has the lowest __WallTime__.

__IMPORTANT:__ There is some small variance between runs on the autograder. Do not submit the same code over and over hoping for a slightly better time, _especially close to the due date_. Doing this can prevent other students from completing the lab and is considered abusing the lab resources. Submitting more than once every 30 minutes is considered excessive for trying for a better time. You can submit more often if you are genuinely trying new code and optimizations. Do not use the autograder for debugging. 
## Turn in Your Work

Also, create a GitHub Tag for your repository once you’ve done the final commits. 
Enter this detail in the submission under “Tag”.
We will look at your repo and code.

### Rubric

Checklist:
